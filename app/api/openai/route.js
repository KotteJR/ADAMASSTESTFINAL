- Use every available field, and for each section, synthesize and summarize, providing business insight and context, not just lists.
- For funding_rounds, create a timeline with commentary, highlight % increases between rounds, and add business context (e.g., "Investor confidence increased in 2022 as shown by a 40% jump in Series B funding").
- For financials_metrics, calculate and include revenue/profit/EBITDA growth rates, ratios, and trends if possible (e.g., year-over-year growth, margins, etc.).
- For news_press, summarize trends and key themes, not just headlines (e.g., "Recent news focuses on expansion and regulatory approval").
- For each section, use every available field, and if data is partial, infer or estimate contextually (never invent specific facts, but do expand and contextualize as a consultant would).
- Output a JSON object with both raw and derived/creative fields (e.g., growth_percentages, funding_commentary, news_trends, etc.).
- Use a consulting-style, business-analytical tone throughout.
- Output only the JSON object, nothing else.

Additionally, extract, calculate, and return all data needed for graphs:
- For revenue growth: return an array of {year, revenue, profit, ebitda, revenue_growth_percent, profit_growth_percent, ebitda_growth_percent} for each year available.
- For investment history: return an array of {round_name, date, amount_raised, percent_increase_from_previous} for each round.
- For market presence: return an array of {location, type} (type=headquarters or other) for mapping.
- Add a new top-level field: 'graph_data' with keys: 'revenue_growth', 'investment_history', 'market_presence'.
- Always fill these arrays as fully as possible, inferring or estimating from the unstructured data, and be consistent in structure.

Return a JSON object with this structure:
- company_overview: {
    official_company_name, website, overview, industry, headquarters, other_locations, founding_date, founders, key_team_members, number_of_employees, company_mission, unique_selling_points, products_services, main_competitors, ip_trademarks
  }
- financials_metrics: {
    revenue, profit, ebitda, it_spend, web_visits, growth_scores (year-over-year), active_website_tech_count, growth_percentages (object with revenue, profit, ebitda, etc.), financial_commentary (business insight)
  }
- funding_rounds: {
    rounds: [ { round_name, date, amount_raised, number_of_investors, lead_investors, all_investors, percent_increase_from_previous } ],
    total_funding_amount,
    funding_commentary (business insight)
  }
- investors: [ ... ]
- news_press: [ { date, headline, publication, summary, link } ],
  news_trends (summary of key themes)
- acquisitions: [ ... ]
- customer_testimonials: [ ... ]
- contact_information: { email, phone, address, other }
- graph_data: {
    revenue_growth: [ { year, revenue, profit, ebitda, revenue_growth_percent, profit_growth_percent, ebitda_growth_percent } ],
    investment_history: [ { round_name, date, amount_raised, percent_increase_from_previous } ],
    market_presence: [ { location, type } ]
  }

Instructions:
- For each section, use all relevant info from the raw content. If a field is missing, add a plausible summary or "No data available".
- For company_overview, summarize the company's business, industry, and unique points. List all available founders and key team members.
- For financials_metrics, include all available numbers and growth scores. If missing, estimate or state "No data available". Calculate and include growth_percentages and financial_commentary.
- For funding_rounds, list all rounds and investors, and total funding. Calculate percent_increase_from_previous for each round, and add funding_commentary.
- For news_press, include recent news with summaries and links. Add news_trends summarizing key themes.
- For contact_information, include all available contact details. If missing, state "No data available".
- For graph_data, always fill the arrays as fully as possible, inferring or estimating from the unstructured data, and be consistent in structure.
- Do NOT invent specific facts, but do synthesize plausible summaries or placeholders for missing data.
- Expand and contextualize wherever possible, as a consultant would, to maximize business insight and utility.
